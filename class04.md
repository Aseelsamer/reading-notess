#LINKS:
Links are created using the <a> element. Users can click on anything between the opening <a> tag and the closing </a> tag. You specify which page you want to link to using the href attribute.

The text between the opening <a> tag and closing </a> tag is known as link text.
When you are linking to other pages within the same site,
you do not need to specify the domain name in the URL. You
can use a shorthand known as a relative URL.

Every page and every image on
a website has a URL and this URL is
made up of the domain name
followed by the path to that page
or image.
Relative URLs can be used when linking to pages within your own
website. They provide a shorthand way of telling the browser where to
find your files.


#LAYOUT:
Building blocks:CSS treats each HTML element as if it is in its
own box. This box will either be a block-level
box or an inline box.

If one block-level element sits inside another
block-level element then the outer box is
known as the containing or parent element.

Controlling the position of elements:
Normal flow : every block elements appears on a new line.
Relative positioning :this moves an element from position to another(top , right , bottom or left)
Absolute positioning: this positions the element in relation to its containing element.

To indicate where a box should be positioned, you may also need to use box offset properties to tell the browser how far from the top or bottom and left or right it should be placed. 

Different visitors to your site will have different sized screens that show different amounts of information, so your design needs to be able to work on a range of different sized screens.
Resolution refers to the number of dots a screen shows per inch. 
Some devices have a higher resolution than desktop computers and most operating systems allow users to adjust the resolution of their screens.
Fixed width layout designs do not change size as the
user increases or decreases the size of their browser window.
Liquid layout designs stretch and contract as the user increases or decreases the size of their browser
window. They use percentages.

#FUNCTTIONS , METHODS AND OBJECTS:
Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task. If different parts of a script repeat the same task, you can reuse the function .
To create a function you give it a name and write a statement to achieve the task inside curly brackets.
To call a function you declare it first and then execute all statements in curly brackets with just one line of code.
There is something called parameters used when you need specific information to perform task.

Some functions return values to the code that called them(when you perform the calculation they return the result).
If you want to return more than one value in a function you use something called array.

#PAIR PROGRAMMING :

2-Engaged collaboration    3- Learning from fellow students
4-Social skills            5-Job interview readiness
