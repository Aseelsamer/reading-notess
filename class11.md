# IMAGES:
-You can control the size of an
image using the width and
height properties in CSS, just
like you can for any other box

-Specifying image sizes helps
pages to load more smoothly
because the HTML and CSS
code will often load before the
images

There are two ways to align images:
1-the float property is added to the class that was created.
2-New classes are created with names such as align-left or align-right.

-In order to center an image, it
should be turned into a blocklevel element using the display
property with a value of block. 

-The background-image
property allows you to place
an image behind any HTML
element. This could be the entire
page or just part of the page. By
default, a background image will
repeat to fill the entire box.

- We have something called background-repeat and it can have four values:
1-repeat : image is repeated horizontally and vertically.
2-repeat-x:image is repeated horizontally only.
3-repeat-y: image is repeated vertically only.
4-no-repeat.

-Using CSS, it is possible to create
a link or button that changes to a
second style when a user moves
their mouse over it (known as a
rollover) and a third style when
they click on it. 

-If you want to overlay text on a background image, the image must be low
contrast in order for the text to be legible.

# PRACTICAL INFORMATIONS:

The following pages will help you understand the key concepts so you can
improve your website's visibility on search engines.

In every page of your website there are seven key places where keywords
(the words people might search on to find your site) can appear in order
to improve its findability.

Here are six steps that
will help you identify the right keywords and phrases for your site.

likely to want to know. In particular, it tells you how many people are
coming to your site.

-In order to put your site on the web you will need a domain name(web address) and web hosting(upload it on a web server).

-To transfer your code and images from your
computer to your hosting company, you use
something known as File Transfer Protocol it allows you to transfer files accross the internet from you computer to the web server hosting your site.

# FLASH:
Since the late 1990s, Flash has been a very
popular tool for creating animations, and later for playing audio and video in websites.
