*TEXT:*
HTML has six levels of headings starting from h1 to h6 .
h1 is used for main headings , h2 is used for subheadings and so on. 
the paragraph and every single text in the HTML should have an opening and closing tags , the <b> would make your text BOLD and <i> will make it ITALICS .
<sup> is used to contain characters that should be superscript such as the suffix of dates (raising a number to power ) but <sub> is used to contain characters that should be subscript.
the <br> add a line break inside the middle of paragraph,
you can use <strong> to tell that this content is strong important , the <blockqoute> is used for long quotes that take up entire paragraph. 
the <q> is used for short quotations , <abbr> used for abbreviations , the <address> element is used to contact details for the author of the page .
The <ins> element can be usedto show content that has beeninserted into a document, while the <del> element can show text that has been deleted from it.

*INTRODUCING TO CSS:*
CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box is presented.
CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules governhow the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.
CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. The <link> element can be used in an HTML document to tell the browser where to find the CSS file used to style the page.You can also include CSS rules
within an HTML page by placing them inside a <style> element, which usually sits inside the <head> element of the page. 

NOTE:***When building a site with more than one page, you should use an external CSS style sheet.***

*JAVASCRIPT INSTRUCTIONS:*
-A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow one-by-one.
-Each individual instruction or step is known as a statement.
-Satements should end with a semicolon. 
-You should write comments to explain what your code does.They help make your code easier to read and understand so it will help you and others who read your code. 
VARIABLES : var is an example of what programmers call a keyword. in order to use the variable, you must give it a name, if the variable name is more than one word you write on camelCase. the equal sign used in var is known as assignment operator.
You should consider using an array whenever you are working with a list or a set of values that are related to each other. Arrays are especially helpful when you do not know how many items a list will contain .

An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking
there are two types of expressions. 
1-EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A
VALUE TO A VARIABLE 
2-EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR
MORE VALUES TO RETURN A
SINGLE VALUE 

Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to
create a single value from one or more values. 
1-ASSIGNMENT OPERATORS 
2-COMPARISON OPERATORS 
3-ARITHMETIC OPERATORS (+,-,/,*,%)
4-LOGICAL OPERATORS 
5-STRING OPERATOR (There is just one string operator: the+ symbol.It is used to join the strings on either side of it. )

*DECISIONS AND LOOPS:*
Flowcharts can help you plan the occasions where decisions are made.
There are two components to a decision ;
1-expression is evaluated , which returns a value.
2-A conditional statement says what to do in a given situation

-You can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you expect it might be.
== is equal to 
!= is not equal to 

--Comparison operators : there is usually one operator and two operands. and they are placed on each side of the operator and they can be values or variables.
Openends can be expressions (Score1+Score2)>(Highscore1+Highscore2)

--Logical operators: Allows you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
((5<2)&&(2>=3)) 

--IF STATMENT: this evaluates a condition .
--IF ELSE STATMENT : is checks statment.
